It is build upon the concept of entropy and is used for calculating the difference between two probability distributions for a given random variable or set of events.\n","\n","To introduce this function, remember that *information* quantifies the number of bits required to encode and/or transmit an event. **Lower probability events have more information, higher probability events have less information**.\n","\n","In information theory is importat the notion of “surprise” of an event. An event is more surprising the less likely it is, meaning it contains more information. Hence: \n","\n","- **Low probability Event (surprising): More information.**\n","\n","- **Higher Probability Event (unsurprising): Less information.**\n","\n","#### Quantifying Information\n","\n","Information $h(x)$ can be calculated for an event x, given the probability of the event $P(x)$ is defined as\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","h(x) = - \\log [P(x)].\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","From this definition it is easy to check that the information associated with an event $x_1$ with probability of occurrence $P(x_1) =1$ is $h(x_1) = -\\log [1] = 0$, i.e. this event has no information associated.\n","\n","On the other hand, the information probability associated with an event $x_0$ with a low probability of occurrence $P(x_0) \\rightarrow 0$ is $h(x_0) = -\\log [P(x_0)] \\rightarrow \\infty$, i.e. this event has a large amount of information associated.\n","\n","#### Entropy \n","\n","Entropy is defined as the number of bits required to transmit a randomly selected event from a probability distribution. \n","\n","A skewed distribution has a low entropy (low information associated), whereas a distribution where events have equal probability has a larger entropy (high information associated). This fact can be undertood by noting that skewed probability distribution has less “surprise” and in turn a low entropy because likely events dominate. On the other hand, balanced distribution are more surprising and turn have higher entropy because events are equally likely.\n","\n","- **Skewed Probability Distribution (unsurprising): Low entropy.**\n","\n","- **Balanced Probability Distribution (surprising): High entropy.**\n","\n","Mathematically, entropy can be calculated for a set $X$ of discrete states $x$, with a probability $P(x)$ of occurence, as\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","S[P(X)] = -\\sum_{x \\in X} P(x) \\log [P(x)].\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","Here, the $\\log$ is the base-2 logarithm, meaning that the results are in **bits**  (If the base-e or natural logarithm is used instead, the result will have the units called **nats**).\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","In order to understand this definition, consider a set of 3 discrete events $X = [x_1, x_2, x_3]$ with probabilities of occurrence $P(X) = [P(x_1), P(x_2), P(x_3)] = [0, 1, 0]$, i.e. event $x_2$ has 100% probability occurrence while $x_1$ and $x_3$ have 0% of probability.
