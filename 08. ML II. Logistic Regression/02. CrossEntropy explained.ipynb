    "## The Cross-Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-entropy is a function arising from the field of information theory. It is build upon the concept of entropy and is used for calculating the difference between two probability distributions for a given random variable or set of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce this function, remember that *information* quantifies the number of bits required to encode and/or transmit an event. **Lower probability events have more information, higher probability events have less information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In information theory is importat the notion of “surprise” of an event. An event is more surprising the less likely it is, meaning it contains more information. Hence: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low probability Event (surprising): More information.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher Probability Event (unsurprising): Less information.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantifying Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Information $h(x)$ can be calculated for an event x, given the probability of the event $P(x)$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "h(x) = - \\log [P(x)].\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "From this definition it is easy to check that the information associated with an event $x_1$ with probability of occurrence $P(x_1) =1$ is $h(x_1) = -\\log [1] = 0$, i.e. this event has no information associated.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the information probability associated with an event $x_0$ with a low probability of occurrence $P(x_0) \\rightarrow 0$ is $h(x_0) = -\\log [P(x_0)] \\rightarrow \\infty$, i.e. this event has a large amount of information associated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entropy \n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy is defined as the number of bits required to transmit a randomly selected event from a probability distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "A skewed distribution has a low entropy (low information associated), whereas a distribution where events have equal probability has a larger entropy (high information associated). This fact can be undertood by noting that skewed probability distribution has less “surprise” and in turn a low entropy because likely events dominate. On the other hand, balanced distribution are more surprising and turn have higher entropy because events are equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Skewed Probability Distribution (unsurprising): Low entropy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Balanced Probability Distribution (surprising): High entropy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, entropy can be calculated for a set $X$ of discrete states $x$, with a probability $P(x)$ of occurence, as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "S[P(X)] = -\\sum_{x \\in X} P(x) \\log [P(x)].\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the $\\log$ is the base-2 logarithm, meaning that the results are in **bits**  (If the base-e or natural logarithm is used instead, the result will have the units called **nats**).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
